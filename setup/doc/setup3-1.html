    </P
><P
>     The 'version' string defines the version of the application and table code. This would be incremented whenever you create a new upgrade function, and typically only for table modifications. If the change is significant from the last code update, you could increment this here also. Incrementing this version string is not trivial, so please do read the rest of this document for more information about that.
    </P
><P
>     'app_order' determines the order of applications in the navbar. If the number you set here is the same as is set for another app, the app whose 'name' is first in the English alphabet would appear first. Smaller numbers show closer to the top or left end of the navbar, depending upon the layout.
    </P
><P
>     The 'enable' string is used by the egroupware API to determine whether an application is disabled, enabled, or enabled but hidden from the navbar. Most applications will want this set to a value of 1 (enabled). The notifywindow app sets this to 2, which keeps it off the navbar. An enable of 0 would disable the app by default. There is one other special case, 3, which is used primarily by the API itself. From the perspective of setup3, the API is an application just like any other application. By setting the 'enable' flag to 3, the API is still enabled, but will not be assignable to a user as a real application. It will thereby be hidden from the admin for application and user/group editing.

Using a multipass function, the applications are installed in the correct order to ensure that dependencies are resolved.

The simplest version upgrade routine would look like:

></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>     This upgrade function merely updates the current version number. Note that there is not only an upgrade function, but also the setting of a value in the $test array. The name 'test' is a holdover from the old setup program, and is an arbitrary choice. However, this name must be used for the upgrade process to work. Prior to each of your upgrade functions, add the value of the previous version to $test.
    </P
><P
>     Now look at the function name. The name is important and should be structured as the application name and the version from which you are intending to upgrade. The '.'s in the version string are replaced with '_'.
    </P
><P
>     Inside the function, we global the $setup_info array. Next, we alter the version number in that array, for our application. Please be careful to specify YOUR application name here. The very last thing we do is to return this new version to the calling function. The upgrade process relies on the value returned, since it uses this directly to determine the new version. This may appear illogical on some level, but it does work. The reason for returning this value instead of a True or 1, etc. has to do with variable scope and lifetime. In this way, even the globaling of $setup_info inside the function may have little effect on the upgrade process. But, there may be values in this array you would want to use within the function. More on that later.
    </P
><P
>     There is one other variable you would need if doing any database operations here. If you global $phpgw_setup, you will then have access to db and schema_proc objects and functions. The objects of interest here are:

></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>     $phpgw_setup-&gt;oProc
     </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>     $phpgw_setup-&gt;db.
     </P
></LI
></UL
><P
>     For most database work you should use the oProc object. This also has a db object that should be used for most standard phpgw API db class functions, including $db-&gt;query, next_record, num_rows, and f. The use of these for standard db operations is critical to the upgrade process. Schema_proc has a flag that can be set to determine what mode of upgrade we are in. This flag is set in the setup class during the upgrade process, and should not be altered locally.
    </P
><P
>     This flag is a decision on whether to alter the database or the schema_proc array. The tables_baseline file above is loaded by setup prior to running your upgrade routines. If the current installed version is greater than the current upgrade routine, we don't need to alter the database yet. But schema_proc instead alters the $phpgw_baseline array in memory. The maintenance of this array is done even when we do alter the database. Once our version number in the test array matches the currently installed version of an application, real work on the tables begins.
    </P
><P
>     'Why bother modifying this array at all', you may ask. The array must be maintained in order to keep current table definition status. This is used in some schema_proc functions when altering columns and tables. This is especially critical for pgsql schema_proc functions.
    </P
><P
>     By using the $phpgw_setup-&gt;oProc object for basic inserts and queries, we acheive the ability to run all upgrade functions in every upgrade cycle without actually altering the database until we reach the current version we actually want to upgrade. For example:
