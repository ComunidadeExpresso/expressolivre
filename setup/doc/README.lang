Files in setup/lang are for setup only.  Please see each app/setup dir
for app-specific and phpgwap/setup for global langs.

These files MUST be tab-delimited:

phrase{TAB}application{TAB}langcode{TAB}Output Phrase

e.g.

hello	common	en	Hello

The languages file is a list of the languages we would support.
This is loaded and a dir listing is done to see what is then
available.  The results are shown in the login page.
