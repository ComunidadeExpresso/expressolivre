kses TODO
=========

* remove stuff in between <script>..</script> and <style>..</style>

* more attribute value checks

* more types of hooks

* return array of removed elements and attributes

* give the option of turning unacceptable elements to entities instead of
  removing them (and turn unacceptable attributes to their own tag, which is
  then turned to entities?) .. perhaps turn to comments as well?

* XHTML tags of the style <br/> instead of <br />
  This is related to a small bug with <a href="blah />
  Solution: rewrite parser.

* ">" in HTML tags
  <img src="blah.gif" alt="x > 5">
  Not very important, but..

* lots of testing

* write better documentation

* feedback from users

* create a nice homepage (any volunteers?)
