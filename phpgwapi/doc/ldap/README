This directory contains schema files for use the with various
LDAP servers to which we have access.  Openldap 1.X is very
forgiving, and it is not required to load this schema in all
cases.  Openldap 2.X is less forgiving and requires schema
definitions for all objectclasses and attributes.


Openldap 1.X:

The following are for use with openldap 1.X:
	phpgw.oc.conf	defines the phpgwAccount objectclass
	phpgw.at.conf	defines our special attributes

They should be copied to /etc/openldap and added to
/etc/openldap/slapd.conf AFTER other similar include lines:

include		/etc/openldap/phpgw.oc.conf
include		/etc/openldap/phpgw.at.conf
include		/etc/openldap/phpgwcontact.oc.conf
include		/etc/openldap/phpgwcontact.at.conf


Openldap 2.X:

The following are for use with openldap 2.X:
	phpgwaccount.schema		defines the phpgwAccount objectclass and our attributes
	phpgwcontact.schema		defines the phpgwContact objectclass and our attributes

These should be copied to /etc/openldap/schema and added to
/etc/openldap/slapd.conf AFTER other similar include lines.  These files
rely on core.schema and cosine.schema at least:

include		/etc/openldap/schema/phpgwaccount.schema
include		/etc/openldap/schema/phpgwcontact.schema

You may need to adjust your indexes to the following:

index default eq
index objectClass eq
index phpgwContactOwner pres,eq,sub
index uidNumber pres,eq

The Private Enterprise Code/OID for phpgroupware is 1.3.6.1.4.1.9554,
registered via IANA and assigned on May 16 2001.  This is registered
under the name Clear River Technologies, LLC.


Netscape/iPlanet:

The following are for use with Netscape/iPlanet Directory Server:
	iplanet/phpgw.at.conf	defines our special attributes for accounts
	iplanet/phpgw.oc.conf	defines the phpgwAccount objectclass
	iplanet/phpgwcontact.at.conf	defines our special attributes for contacts
	iplanet/phpgwcontact.oc.conf	defines the phpgwContact objectclass

They should be copied to /usr/netscape/server4/slapd-HOST/config and added to
/usr/netscape/server4/slapd-HOST/config/slapd.conf AFTER other similar
include lines:

include		/etc/openldap/phpgw.oc.conf
include		/etc/openldap/phpgw.at.conf
include		/etc/openldap/phpgwcontact.oc.conf
include		/etc/openldap/phpgwcontact.at.conf


Novell eDirectory:

The following are for use with Novell eDirectory (EXPERIMENTAL):
	phpgwaccount.nds.schema
	phpgwcontact.nds.schema
