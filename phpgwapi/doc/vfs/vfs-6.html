<H2><A NAME="sec:database"></A> <A NAME="ss6.1">6.1</A> <A HREF="vfs.html#toc6.1">Database</A>
</H2>

<P>Data about the files and directories within the virtual root
is kept in the SQL database. Currently, this information includes:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>File ID (used internally, primary key for table)</LI>
<LI>Owner ID (phpGW account_id)</LI>
<LI>Created by ID (phpGW account_id)</LI>
<LI>Modified by ID (phpGW account_id)</LI>
<LI>Created (date)</LI>
<LI>Modified (date)</LI>
<LI>Size (bytes)</LI>
<LI>MIME type</LI>
<LI>Deleteable (Y/N/Other?)</LI>
<LI>Comment</LI>
<LI>App (appname of application that created the file)</LI>
<LI>Directory (directory the file or directory is in)</LI>
<LI>Name (name of file or directory)</LI>
<LI>Link directory (if the file or directory is linked, what the
actual directory is)</LI>
<LI>Link name (if the file or directory is linked, what the actual
name is)</LI>
<LI>Version (numeric version of the file)</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>The internal names of these (the database column names) are stored
in the $GLOBALS['phpgw']-&gt;vfs-&gt;attributes
array, which is useful for loops, and is guaranteed to be up-to-date.</P>
<P>Note that no information is kept about files outside the virtual
root. If a file is moved outside, all records of it are deleted from
the database (other than the journaling records). If a file is moved
into the virtual root, some information, specifically MIME-type,
is not always stored in the database. The vital information has defaults:
owner is based on where the file is being stored; size is correctly
read; deleteable is set to Y.</P>
<H2><A NAME="sec:acl_support"></A> <A NAME="ss6.2">6.2</A> <A HREF="vfs.html#toc6.2">ACL support</A>
</H2>

<P>ACL support is built into the VFS. vfs-&gt;acl_check () does
the actual checking, and is called from all VFS functions as needed.
If the file or directory sent to acl_check () doesn't exist, the
permissions for the parent directory are used to determine access.
ACL checking can be overridden at any time by setting vfs-&gt;override_acl.
For example:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
$GLOBALS['phpgw']-&gt;vfs-&gt;override_acl = 1;
$GLOBALS['phpgw']-&gt;vfs-&gt;mkdir (array(
     'string' =&gt; $GLOBALS['fakebase']. '/' . $group_array['account_name'],
     'relatives' =&gt; array(
          RELATIVE_NONE
     )
));
$GLOBALS['phpgw']-&gt;vfs-&gt;override_acl = 0;
</PRE>
</P>
<H2><A NAME="sec:function_aliases"></A> <A NAME="ss6.3">6.3</A> <A HREF="vfs.html#toc6.3">Function aliases</A>
</H2>

<P>You might have noticed there are some functions that just pass
the arguments on to other functions. These are provided in part because
of legacy and in part for convenience. You can use either. Here is
the list (alias -&gt; actual):</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>copy -&gt; cp</LI>
<LI>move -&gt; rm</LI>
<LI>delete -&gt; rm</LI>
<LI>dir -&gt; ls</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<H2><A NAME="sec:fakebase"></A> <A NAME="ss6.4">6.4</A> <A HREF="vfs.html#toc6.4">Fakebase directory (changing /home)</A>
</H2>

<P>The old VFS was hard-coded to use '/home' as the fake base directory,
even though the user never saw it. With the new system, crafty administrators
may wish to change '/home' to something else, say '/users' or '/public_html'.
The fake base directory name is stored in $GLOBALS['phpgw']-&gt;vfs-&gt;fakebase,
and changing it will transparently change it throughout the VFS and
all applications. However, this must be done <EM>before</EM> any data is in
the VFS database. If you wish to change it afterwords, you'll have
to manually update the database, replacing the old value with the
new value. <EM>Application programmers need to recognize that /home is
not absolute, and use $GLOBALS['phpgw']-&gt;vfs-&gt;fakebase
instead</EM>. I suggest setting $fakebase = $GLOBALS['phpgw']-&gt;vfs-&gt;fakebase;
right off the bat to keep things neater.</P>
