<P>You must explicitly enable the VFS class. To do this, set 'enable_vfs_class'
to True in $GLOBALS['phpgw_info']['flags'].
An example:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
$GLOBALS['phpgw_info']['flags'] = array(
     'currentapp' =&gt; 'filemanaer',
     'noheader' =&gt; False,
     'noappheader' =&gt; False,
     'enable_vfs_class' =&gt; True,
     'enable_browser_class' =&gt; True
);
</PRE>

</H2>

<P>The VFS in located in phpgwapi/inc/class.vfs_sql.inc.php. You
can look over it, but I don't suggest trying to understand how it
works. It isn't necessary to know its internals to use it, but you
may find the inline comments helpful. The basic things to keep in
mind:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Files and directories are synonymous in almost all cases</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>
<PRE>
$GLOBALS['phpgw']-&gt;vfs-&gt;mv (array(
     'from' =&gt; 'file1',
     'to' =&gt; 'dir/file2'
));

$GLOBALS['phpgw']-&gt;vfs-&gt;mv (array(
     'from' =&gt; 'dir1',
     'to' =&gt; 'dir/dir1'
));

$GLOBALS['phpgw']-&gt;vfs-&gt;rm (array(
     'string' =&gt; 'file'
));

$GLOBALS['phpgw']-&gt;vfs-&gt;rm (array(
     'string' =&gt; 'dir'
));
</PRE>
</P>
<P>All work as you would except them to. The major exception is:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
$GLOBALS['phpgw']-&gt;vfs-&gt;touch (array(
     'string' =&gt; 'file'
));
</PRE>
</P>
<P>vs.</P>
<P>
<PRE>
$GLOBALS['phpgw']-&gt;vfs-&gt;mkdir (array(
     'string' =&gt; 'dir'
));
</PRE>
</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Users and groups are synonymous</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>As far as the actual paths are concerned, users and groups are
the same. /home/username works the same as /home/groupname.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>You should never have to know the real paths of files</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>One of the VFS's responsibilities is to translate paths for you.
While you certainly <EM>can</EM> operate using full paths, it is much simpler
to use the virtual paths. For example, instead of using:</P>
<P>
<PRE>
$GLOBALS['phpgw']-&gt;vfs-&gt;cp (array(
     'from' =&gt; '/var/www/egroupware/files/home/user/file1',
     'to' =&gt; '/var/www/egroupware/files/home/user/file2',
     'relatives' =&gt; array(
          RELATIVE_NONE|VFS_REAL,
          RELATIVE_NONE|VFS_REAL
     )
));
</PRE>
</P>
<P>you might use</P>
<P>
<PRE>
$GLOBALS['phpgw']-&gt;vfs-&gt;cp (array(
     'from' =&gt; '/home/user/file1',
     'to' =&gt; '/home/user/file2',
     'relatives' =&gt; array(
          RELATIVE_NONE,
          RELATIVE_NONE
     )
));
</PRE>
</P>
<P>(We'll get to the RELATIVE's in a minute.)</P>
<P>Site administrators should be able to move their files dir around
on their system and know that everything will continue to work smoothly.</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Relativity is <EM>vital</EM></LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Relativity is a new feature in the VFS, and its importance cannot
be stressed enough. It will make your life much easier, especially
for file system intensive applications, but it will take some getting
used to. If something doesn't work right the first time, chances
are great it has to do with incorrect relativity settings. We will
deal with relativity in depth in the Relativity section.</P>
