-------------------------------
- Suggested PHP Configuration -
-------------------------------

This is a suggested php.ini config for running phpGroupWare 0.9.14 on php4. It 
is roughly in the order of the paramters in you php.ini file. These recommendations
are based on feedback from users and developers.

RESOURCES
max_execution_time = 90
This allows for encoding/decoding large file attachments on slower machines and
other complex functions.

memory_limit = 20M  
At least this value should help with more complex operations.

ERRORS
error_reporting = E_ALL  ~E_NOTICE
Having this set to E_ALL, will cause all types of problems if left to
display on the screen.  E_NOTICE are no-fatal errors such as undefined
variable etc.  Having this set to E_ALL only will dramatically increase
the size of your log files if you log erros.

display_errors = Off
This can cause header output problems if left on.  They are better stored in you
log file and that way you have a record of any problems.

log_errors = On
See above.

DATABASES
[dbms].allow_persistent = On
This must be set to on if you want to use persistent databse
connections.  Change [dbms] to what ever db you want to use ie mysql or
pgsql

FILE UPLOADING
file_uploads = On
If you want to use email,phpwebhosting, infolog or any apps that upload files 
this must be set to on.

upload_max_filesize = 5M
At least this.  This will allow for larger email attachments and
phpwebhosting files.  Use filesize * 4 = memory_limit to allow for
base64 encodes.

PHP4 SESSIONS
session.save_path = /tmp
Your httpd must be able to read and write to this directory, if you
intend to use php4 sessions.

session.gc_maxlifetime = 1440
Set this to what you want to be your session time out limit.  It is in
second so set it to 3660 if you want it to one hour ... the default is
24mins, which is generally too short.

REGISTER GLOBALS
register_globals = On
Until release 0.9.14 phpGroupWare will not work, if the value is set to Off.
All further releases will support the Off setting.
