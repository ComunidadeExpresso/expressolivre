Minor TODOs:

- Remove the Email/Telephone Card Fields selection from Preferences and put it
  on Admin Config Page (v0.4.3)

- populateFullAddConst is in JS but I think it is unnecessary, as changes to this
  fields should be rare. Replace it with a pre-load from PHP (v0.4.4)

- Insert a Full Add Constant Fields Configuration/Insertion/Removal Interface
  for Admin (v0.5.1)

- Interface to manage Quick Add fields, as the back-end and plugin already 
  accepts dynamic selected fields (v0.6.1)
  


Important TODOs:

- City/State Management (see README.city) (v0.5.0)
- Insert Companies Catalog (v0.5.0)
- Insert Table View (v0.6.0)
- Card must be object (v0.6.5)
- Replace serialize/unserialize engine with XML-RPC (v0.7.0)
