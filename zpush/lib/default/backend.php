* File      :   backend.php
* Project   :   Z-Push
* Descr     :   This is what C++ people
*               (and PHP5) would call an
*               abstract class. The
*               backend module itself is
*               responsible for converting any
*               necessary types and formats.
*
*               If you wish to implement a new
*               backend, all you need to do is
*               to subclass the following class
*               (or implement an IBackend)
*               and place the subclassed file in
*               the backend/yourBackend directory. You can
*               then use your backend by
*               specifying it in the config.php file
