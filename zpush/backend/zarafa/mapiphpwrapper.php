* Project   :   Z-Push
* Descr     :   The ICS importer is very MAPI specific
*               and needs to be wrapped, because we
*               want all MAPI code to be separate from
*               the rest of z-push. To do so all
*               MAPI dependency are removed in this class.
*               All the other importers are based on
*               IChanges, not MAPI.
