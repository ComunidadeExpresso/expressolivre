Freeow!
=======

Used by hoopies and froods alike, Freeow! is a plugin for making Growl-like alerts or message boxes on your website. You can customize the look and animation of Freeow! each time a message box appears, and you can alter other options such as whether or not to have the message box hide itself automatically.
